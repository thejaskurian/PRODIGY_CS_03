## Password Strength Assessment Tool

This project involves developing a tool that evaluates password strength based on specific criteria. It provides real-time feedback to users, encouraging the creation of stronger passwords.

## Features

- **Password Strength Assessment:** Evaluate password strength based on length and character variety.

- **Feedback Mechanism:** Provide detailed feedback on password strength and suggest improvements.

- **Real-time Evaluation:** Assess passwords dynamically as users input them.

## Criteria for Password Strength

### Evaluation Factors

- **Length:** Longer passwords are generally stronger, with 12 characters or more recommended.

- **Character Variety:** Include uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters for stronger passwords.

### Feedback on Password Strength

The tool categorizes password strength into the following levels:

- **Weak:** Passwords that are too short or lack character variety.

- **Moderate:** Passwords that have a reasonable length and some character variety but could be stronger.

- **Strong:** Long passwords with a good mix of character types.

- **Very Strong:** Long passwords with diverse characters, avoiding common patterns.
