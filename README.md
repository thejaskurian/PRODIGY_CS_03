Password Strength Assessment Tool
This project involves creating a tool that assesses the strength of passwords based on several criteria. The tool evaluates passwords in real-time and provides feedback to users, encouraging the creation of more secure passwords.

Features
Password Strength Assessment: Evaluate the strength of passwords based on length and character variety.

Feedback Mechanism: Provide feedback on password strength and suggest improvements.

Real-time Evaluation: Assess passwords dynamically as users input them.

Criteria for Password Strength
Evaluation Factors
Length: Longer passwords are generally stronger, with 12 or more characters recommended.

Character Variety: Include uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters for stronger passwords.

Feedback on Password Strength
The tool categorizes password strength into the following levels:

Weak: Passwords that are too short or lack character variety.

Moderate: Passwords that have reasonable length and some character variety but could be stronger.

Strong: Long passwords with a good mix of character types.

Very Strong: Long passwords with diverse characters, avoiding common patterns.
